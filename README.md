## Technical Details

### Dependencies
This project automatically downloads and builds its dependencies using CMake's `FetchContent`:

- **[Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)**: Graphics library for rendering and input
  - Version: Latest from master branch
  - Used for: Window management, 2D rendering, input handling

- **[Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)**: C++ template library for linear algebra
  - Version: 3.4.0
  - Used for: Vector mathematics, physics calculations

### Architecture

#### Physics Engine
The simulation uses a simple Euler integration method for physics updates:
1. Calculate gravitational force: `F = GMm/r¬≤`
2. Apply forces to update acceleration: `a = F/m`
3. Update velocity: `v = v + a*dt`
4. Update position: `p = p + v*dt`

#### Key Classes

**Planet** (`planet.hpp`)
- Manages planet position, mass, and visual representation
- Calculates gravitational force on other objects
- Renders planet with atmospheric effects

**Rocket** (`rocket.hpp`)
- Handles rocket physics (position, velocity, acceleration)
- Provides thrust and rotation controls
- Renders rocket with dynamic thrust visualization
- Displays force vectors for debugging

### Modern C++ Features
This project showcases several C++23 features:
- `std::expected<T, E>` for error handling without exceptions
- Constexpr functions for compile-time evaluation
- `[[nodiscard]]` attributes to prevent value discarding
- Concepts and constraints for type safety
- Designated initializers for cleaner code

## Physics Background

### Orbital Mechanics
The simulation implements fundamental orbital mechanics principles:

- **Circular Orbit Velocity**: v = ‚àö(GM/r)
- **Gravitational Force**: F = GMm/r¬≤
- **Escape Velocity**: v = ‚àö(2GM/r)

Where:
- G = Gravitational constant (adjustable in simulation)
- M = Planet mass
- m = Rocket mass
- r = Distance from planet center

### Achieving Stable Orbits
To achieve a circular orbit:
1. Position the rocket at desired orbital altitude
2. The simulation automatically calculates the required orbital velocity
3. Velocity is applied perpendicular to the planet-rocket direction
4. Fine-tune with manual thrust controls

## Tips for Exploration

1. **Circular Orbits**: Right-click to place rocket, it will start with orbital velocity
2. **Elliptical Orbits**: After placing, use thrust to increase or decrease velocity
3. **Escape Trajectory**: Apply significant forward thrust to exceed escape velocity
4. **Gravity Slingshot**: Increase planet gravity while in orbit for dramatic effects
5. **Time Manipulation**: Use slow-motion to observe fine orbital details

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

**CMake Error: Could not find OpenGL**
```bash
# Linux
sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev

# macOS
# OpenGL comes with Xcode Command Line Tools
```

**Compilation Error: C++23 features not supported**
- Ensure you're using a modern compiler (GCC 13+, Clang 16+, MSVC 2022+)
- Update CMake to version 3.25 or higher

### Runtime Issues

**Window doesn't open**
- Ensure graphics drivers are up to date
- Check that your system supports OpenGL

**Performance issues**
- Reduce zoom level
- Decrease time scale
- Update graphics drivers

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future development:
- Multiple celestial bodies with n-body physics
- Fuel system with limited propellant
- Mission objectives and challenges
- Trajectory prediction and planning tools
- Save/load simulation states
- Configuration file for custom scenarios
- Additional celestial bodies (moons, asteroids)
